What is SQLite ?

SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a database, which is zero-configured, which means like other databases you do not need to configure it in your system.

SQLite engine is not a standalone process like other databases, you can link it statically or dynamically as per your requirement with your application. SQLite accesses its storage files directly.


Why SQLite ?

- SQLite does not require a separate server process or system to operate (serverless).

- SQLite comes with zero-configuration, which means no setup or administration needed.

- A complete SQLite database is stored in a single cross-platform disk file.

- SQLite is very small and light weight, less than 400KiB fully configured or less than 250KiB with optional features omitted.

- SQLite is self-contained, which means no external dependencies.

- SQLite transactions are fully ACID-compliant, allowing safe access from multiple processes or threads.

- SQLite supports most of the query language features found in SQL92 (SQL2) standard.

- SQLite is written in ANSI-C and provides simple and easy-to-use API.

- SQLite is available on UNIX (Linux, Mac OS-X, Android, iOS) and Windows (Win32, WinCE, WinRT).
